                        Being a Computer Science graduate, technicalities are of immense importance to me, but i have gone on
                        to discover how equally important it is to have a user centered design and plan in order for your application
                        or service to be met with any success. That's why i went on to learn UX Research, UI Design, and became versed with
                        the latest design tools and fundamentals
